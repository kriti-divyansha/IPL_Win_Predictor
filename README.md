This project uses a trained machine learning model to predict the winning probabilities of an IPL team during a match based on live match parameters.

Overview:
- Uses match data including runs left, balls remaining, wickets, current and required run rate.
- Encodes inputs and uses a pipeline with a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- The output is a prediction of win probability for the batting and bowling team.
