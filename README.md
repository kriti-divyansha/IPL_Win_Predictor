This project is a live demo of an interactive web app built using Streamlit and powered by a Machine Learning pipeline to predict the win probability of an IPL team during a match in real time.

| Component        | Technology               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn, Pandas     |
| Model Deployment | Streamlit                |
| UI               | HTML/CSS (via Streamlit) |
| Hosting          | Streamlit Cloud          |

Overview:
- Uses match data including runs left, balls remaining, wickets, current and required run rate.
- Encodes inputs and uses a pipeline with a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- The output is a prediction of win probability for the batting and bowling team.
